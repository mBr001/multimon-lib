multimin-lib

Is library based on multimon program used to decode digital radio 
transmissions.

This port is maily used to decode ZVEI codes but other should work too.

Supported transmission types

 * AX.25
   * 1200 Baud AFSK
   * 2400 Baud AFSK (2 variants)
   * 4800 Baud HAPN
   * 9600 Baud FSK (G3RUH)
 * Miscellaneous
   * DTMF
   * ZVEI

Support for POCSAG has been remove. It might by much easyli and efectively
handled by separate library. (Need/allow some specific stuff).

With small modification (easy modification of ZVEI frequency table),
is posible decode more squelch (Selcall like) codes. For example
CCIR, EEA, EIA, ZVEI I, ZVEI II, ZVEI III, DZVEI, PZVEI and posibly others.

Patches are wellcome!
